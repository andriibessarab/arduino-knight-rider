## Knight Rider Arduino Project
[](https://i.ibb.co/VSnZGSP/knight-rider-tinkercad.png)
This project was developed by Andrii Bessarab, a student at Country Day School, as part of the TEG3M course with Arduino. The project involves the implementation of a Knight Rider-inspired LED circuit that illuminates a sequence of LEDs in a specific pattern.

### Project Overview
The Knight Rider project is a simple LED circuit that lights up a sequence of LEDs in a specific pattern, reminiscent of the iconic car from the TV show Knight Rider. The circuit is powered by an Arduino board, which controls the sequence of LED lights.

### Implementation
The project was first implemented in Tinkercad, an online platform for designing and simulating circuits. Once the circuit design was finalized, the project was then implemented in real life using physical components. The components were assembled on a breadboard according to the circuit design, and the code was uploaded to the Arduino Uno board.
